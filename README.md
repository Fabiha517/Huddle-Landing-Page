### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the importance of mobile-first design and how difficult layout positioning can become when relying too heavily on `position: absolute`. Initially, I used absolute positioning to overlap content with the background image, but I later realized this required many media queries and made responsiveness harder to manage. In the future, I plan to use Flexbox and Grid more confidently.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my use of CSS Grid
- Rely less on absolute positioning for layout
- Practice creating responsive layouts with fewer media queries
